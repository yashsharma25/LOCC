# LOCC

This software is to  manipulate multi-partite quantum states, compute entanglement measures and optimize LOCC operations, visualise

The software has the following structure:

entanglement_measures.py contains the measures of entanglement length, entanglement fluctuations\\
experiments directory contains example programs

example_bipartite.py contains an example that checks whether two bipartite states are transformable to each other
