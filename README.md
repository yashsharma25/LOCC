This software is to manipulate multi-partite quantum states, compute entanglement measures and optimize LOCC operations and visualise quantums states

# locc directory
1. multiparty_solver.py contains a way to visualise entanglement entropies across a contigous interval and its complement. This visualisation has connections to area law of entropy
2. n_party_states.py contain Absolutely Maximally Entangled (AME) states and an unlockable four_party state
3. k_party.py is the main class used to k_party quantum states and operate over them
4. entanglement_measures.py has the measures of entanglement entropy, localisable entanglement

# Visualisation directory
Visualisation package contains the code to draw and the quantum states visually on a browser

# experiments directory
This contains examples of multipartite states
